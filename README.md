# Water Quality Detection

Water shortage problems in semi-arid areas have become more and more serious in recent years. 
Recent studies show that a lack of water resources could affect nearly 5.5 billion people in 10 years. 
Severe water shortages and large volumes of sewage render river and lake water pollution issues serious in arid areas. 
The water quality of rivers and lakes is becoming central to human and economic development. 
Therefore, the evaluation and estimation of water quality levels is essential for societal and economic development.
Sensors to measure water quality index parameters can help identify various key metrics, 
based on the values in data the variations of each parameter is keenly observed. 
For example, each value can help identify the quality of water and checks whether it is meeting the WHO standards on Water Resource. 
Also, any sudden changes in water quality index level help can generate an alert for operations team to investigate 
the root cause as well as can take necessary steps to prevent the chemical spill and prevent water pollution.
